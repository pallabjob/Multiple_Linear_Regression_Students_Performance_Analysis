🚀 Project Spotlight: Predicting Student Performance with Multiple Linear Regression! 📊📚

I'm excited to share my recent data science project where I applied Multiple Linear Regression to analyze and predict student performance using real-world educational data.

🔍 Objective:
To build a predictive model that estimates student final grades based on various academic, demographic, and personal factors using Python and statistical techniques.

📌 Key Highlights:
✅ Explored a comprehensive dataset including features like study time, failures, absences, parental education, etc.
✅ Performed in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and uncover hidden patterns.
✅ Preprocessed data efficiently—handled nulls, encoded categorical variables, and ensured data quality.
✅ Built a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict final grades (G3).
✅ Evaluated model performance using R² score, RMSE, and residual analysis.

📈 Insights:

Study time and previous grades (G1, G2) strongly influence final performance.

Failures and absences negatively affect outcomes.

Social and lifestyle factors (internet access, romantic relationships) showed mild correlations.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Seaborn | Matplotlib | Scikit-learn | Statsmodels

🔗 Outcome:
Developed a robust regression model that provides meaningful predictions and helps identify factors affecting student success—valuable for educators and academic planners!

💡 This project sharpened my skills in regression modeling, feature engineering, and data interpretation—crucial for any data-driven role.

👉 Looking forward to more such impactful projects! Open to feedback and collaborations. #DataScience #MachineLearning #Python #LinearRegression #StudentPerformance #MLProject #DataAnalytics #OpenToWork #LinkedInProjects
